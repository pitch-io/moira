  "Transform `app` by wrapping it with a [[moira.context|context]] for
  execution of the interceptor chain `txs` on each module in order. In this
  case, `app` refers to the immutable `system-map` directly and *not* to an
  instance of [[moira.application/Application|Application]].

  Dependencies are handled appropriately. When applying an [[up]] transition,
  they are inserted into the `::queue` upfront. Conversely, the transition is
  applied to dependencies subsequently when using the [[down]] command. Any
  circular dependency is detected ahead of execution and will throw an error.

  The [[moira.log|Application Log]] is temporarily paused during transitions.
  All Application Events are buffered and triggered at a later stage when the
  system has settled."
