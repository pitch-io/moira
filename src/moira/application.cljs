   "Construct `Application` instances using [[create]] to properly wrap

   The `->Application` conctructor should never be used by external code
   directly.

   `Application` implements
   [`IDeref`](https://cljs.github.io/api/cljs.core/IDeref),
   [`IWatchable`](https://cljs.github.io/api/cljs.core/IWatchable), and
   [[Thenable]] for inspecting internal system state.

   ```clojure
   ;; get current (potentially transient) system state
   @app ; => {:module-a ,,,}

   ;; call f with next settled system state
   (application/then app f) ; => #<Promise[~]>

   ;; watch app for state changes
   (add-watch app :debug #(pr %4))
   ```

   The implementation of [[Transitionable]] and [[Extendable]] relies on
   [[Chainable]] to execute transitions in a sequential order. The functions
   [[up!]], [[down!]], and [[tx!]] are primarily used internally by the default
   lifecycle commands, including [[start!]], [[stop!]], [[pause!]], and
   [[resume!]].

   ```clojure
   (defn restart! []
     (application/stop! app)
     (application/start! app))

   (when ^boolean js/goog.DEBUG ; development only
     (application/override! app dev-overrides))

     (defn ^:dev/before-load pause []
       (application/pause! app))

     (defn ^:dev/after-load resume []
       (application/resume! app))
   ```

   However, if you want to create your own custom lifecycle commands, you can
   use these functions directly.

   ```clojure
   (defn reset! [app]
     (application/up! app [(module/step :reset)] :all))
